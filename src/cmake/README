How to compile MAPseeker
############################

You will need cmake, ninja, and a C compiler (like gcc):

Inside this directory (map_seeker/src/cmake/), simply run:

cmake -G Ninja
ninja

If you don't have ninja, you can run: 

cmake
make

The application will show up in:

  src/cmake/apps/MAPseeker

You can add this directory to your path with a line like:

 PATH=$PATH:/Users/rhiju/src/map_seeker/src/cmake/apps/

in your .bash_profile or .bashrc file.


##############################################
If you don't have gcc, on Linux, ask your sys admin to install it. 
On a Mac, install XCode (free at the App store).

##############################################
If you don't have cmake, download cmake at http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
Go inside the cmake/ directory in a Terminal, and run 

./bootstrap; make

Install it with:

 sudo make_install

##############################################
If you don't have ninja, download it from http://martine.github.com/ninja/manual.html, and compile it by running

./boostrap.py

Then put ninja in your path with a line in your .bash_profile or .bashrc like:

PATH=$PATH:/Users/rhiju/src/ninja/


[Alternatively, you can run cmake with normal make by typing 'cmake' and then 'make' in this directory, but you really should switch from make to ninja, as ninja is much much faster and smarter.]
